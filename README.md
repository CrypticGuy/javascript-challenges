# Hacking Challenges in JAVASCRIPT
---

So, these are basic challenges I designed for my friend, to test their JS skills and see how it goes.

### Problems
 - Problems will be posted as issues or be added in the ReadMe section

### How to Submit?
 - Fork this project and add the solution in your repo
 - Make a pull request with the solution of JS code and a solution on CodePen
 - When the solution is accepted I will merge it
 - You can also send me a recording of the working solution or a drive or dropbox link of the zip and I'll try and merge it in

### Things to Keep in Mind
 - Write the problems in [Vanilla.js][]
 - Dont use **Jquery** or any other library
 - [Google][] if you need any help
